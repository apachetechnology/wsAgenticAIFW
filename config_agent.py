# Reasoning layer — model per role. Small local models are fine here
# because plans are drawn from a *closed* vocabulary (SUBGOAL_CATALOG
# below), so the LLM is choosing from a known menu rather than
# free-form reasoning — that's what makes 1B-class models reliable
# planners in this setup.

# Action layer — sandbox / permission system. Each tool declares the
# permissions it needs; the execution environment only runs a step if
# every required permission is in the allowed set for that run. WRITE,
# NETWORK, and PLOT are opt-in per-run so destructive or external-facing
# actions stay deliberate; READ/COMPUTE are safe defaults.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ #
# Reasoning layer — closed subgoal vocabulary. One subgoal maps to
# exactly one action-layer tool (see tools.SUBGOAL_TO_TOOL), so the TPA
# only has to pick *which* of these apply to a goal, and the TSA only
# has to extract arguments (owner, fund name, threshold, ...).
